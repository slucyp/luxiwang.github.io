- The Human Capital Reallocation of M&A: Inventor-level analysis, _Draft Forthcoming_

  <span style="font-family:serif;">
  This paper studies the reallocation of innovative labor (i.e., inventors) following mergers and acquisitions (M&A). I find that M&A leads to abnormally higher inventor turnover in target firms. After the merger, the significantly worsened innovative productivity in the target staying inventors is offset by a substantial improvement in patenting performance of both acquirer staying inventors and newly hired inventors, leading to an overall increase in innovative productivity for all staying inventors in the combined entity. The departed inventors show a modest increase in their patenting productivity, and the non-merging firms hiring these departed inventors show significant improvement in patenting performance. Overall, this paper shows empirical evidence that post-merger inventor restructuring has a positive impact on the innovation productivty of both retained and departed inventors and presents suggestive evidence of the positive spillover effect of M&A on firms’ innovation activity which goes beyond the merging companies. </span>

  The rapid increase in U.S. house prices during the 2001-2006 period was accompanied by a historically rapid expansion of bank assets. We exploit cross-regional variation in local housing booms to study how housing demand shocks affected the growth of the banking sector. We estimate the effect of housing demand shocks that are orthogonal to local non-housing demand shocks and a range of observed local credit supply shocks. We employ several instrumental variables that plausibly identify variation in local housing demand that is exogenous to local banks. We find that the housing boom had a large effect on bank asset growth — the cross-regional elasticity of bank growth with respect to housing demand shocks is around 0.6. The regional elasticity estimate suggests that in aggregate, non-credit-supply-induced housing demand shocks can potentially account for more than a third of the growth of the banking sector during this period. </span>
