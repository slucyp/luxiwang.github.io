## Working Papers
- The Human Capital Reallocation of M&A: Inventor-level analysis, _Draft Forthcoming_

  <span style="font-family:serif;">
  **Abstract:** This paper studies the reallocation of innovative labor (i.e., inventors) following mergers and acquisitions (M&A). I find that M&A leads to abnormally higher inventor turnover in target firms. After the merger, the significantly worsened innovative productivity in the target staying inventors is offset by a substantial improvement in patenting performance of both acquirer staying inventors and newly hired inventors, leading to an overall increase in innovative productivity for all staying inventors in the combined entity. The departed inventors show a modest increase in their patenting productivity, and the non-merging firms hiring these departed inventors show significant improvement in patenting performance. Overall, this paper shows empirical evidence that post-merger inventor restructuring has a positive impact on the innovation productivity of both retained and departed inventors and presents suggestive evidence of the positive spillover effect of M&A on firmsâ€™ innovation activity which goes beyond the merging companies. </span>
