## Working Papers
- The Human Capital Reallocation of M&A: Inventor-level analysis, _Draft available upon request_

  <span style="font-family:serif;">
  **Abstract:** Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of innovative firms lead to a significant restructuring of the inventor labor force driven by abnormally high turnover for target firm inventors. Following the merger, inventors in the combined entity (primarily acquiring-firm and newly-hired inventors) file more citation-weighted patents. Departing inventors also increase patenting productivity significantly, and the non-merging firms hiring these inventors improve patenting performance. Overall, these findings indicate that mergers have an economically important impact on the restructuring and productivity of the labor force and provide novel evidence of positive spillover effects of M&A on non-merging firms through post-merger labor restructuring. </span>
