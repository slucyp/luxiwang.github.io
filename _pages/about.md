Welcome to my website! I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at the Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. 

I primarily work in the area of empirical corporate finance. Specifically, my research interest lies at the intersection of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), labor finance, and innovation. My dissertation examines whether M&A transactions lead to a reallocation of innovative labor (i.e., inventors) analogous to real asset reallocation across firms. In addition, I am also interested in empirical banking. 

** I am on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year. **
