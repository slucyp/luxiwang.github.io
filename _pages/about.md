Welcome to my website! I am a 5th year Ph.D. student majoring in Finance at Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh. 

I primarily work in the area of empirical corporate finance. Specifically, my research interest lies at the intersection of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A), labor finance, and innovation. My dissertation examines whether M&A transactions lead to a reallocation in innovative labor (i.e., inventors) analogous to real asset reallocation across firms. In addition, I am also interested in empirical banking.
